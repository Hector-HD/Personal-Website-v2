            <p class="section-sectionName" style="text-align:left;">Summary</p>
            <p><b>Feathir Property Management </b>
                <span class="right"><i>January 2019 - Decmber 2019</i></span><br/><b>ASU Captone Project</b>
                <span class="right"><i>Tempe, AZ</i></span><br/><br/>
                <ul style="list-style:circle;">
                    <p style="text-indent:25px">The Feathir Property Management application is a tool that was created to help property owners manage their properties. The application is divided into two parts. There is a web application where users can view and manage their properties.
                        There is also a mobile application where property managers can create inspections and send inspections to the vendors. This application is filling in a gap in the real estate market to help manage and maintain inspection records.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-indent:25px">Whenever a tenant moves in or out, the property manager has to go through a list of items and verify the items in the property. If any of the items are damaged or need work they write it down on a piece of paper, take a picture, and
                        then email a vendor to come to the property and fix it. Then the property manager has to scan the inspection list and archive the inspection in a local computer. They also have to keep track of which property the inspection paperwork
                        took place at. The Feathir app was created to help make this process easier and more efficient. </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:25px"> By using the Feathir app, the property manager is able to keep track of what properties he manages. If they have to do an inspection for a new or old tenant, all they need to take is their phone. With the mobile app all they have to
                        do is click on the property that they are at, and then create an inspection. The inspection on the phone lets you click on the list of items that need to be checked and if any of them need to be fixed you can just take a picture
                        with your phone and include it into the inspection. In the app you can add vendors to the property that work with the property. The property manager can send the email to the vendor immediately as they finish creating the inspection
                        on the app. All of this can be done by the property manager's phone.
